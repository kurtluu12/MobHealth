1)  Many of the variables were reassigned so I deleted them e.g. *v10 = v11 (just use v11). 
Some variables did not affect the outcome of the return value, o1 e.g. v4. To make the 
code more readable, I separated some arithmetic into more lines, assigning them to new 
values that I made: t1, t2, t3, t4. Also, since   *(int *) &x == x   I deleted all the 
*(int *)s and &s.


2) To verify that my code is correct, I would use the unit testing strategy.


3)  Initially, all the variables are declared and some are assigned to values such as: 0, 1, a1.

The first if statement checks whether or not a1 > 0, since a1 is either 64, 128, or 256,
this statement will always pass. 

Next, there is a nested do-while loop. The first do-while loop first assigns v11 = a2[v6];
v6 is then incremented. Then v12 = a2[v6].

Before the next do-while loop, there is an if statement that checks whether of not 
v9 * (v11 - v12) < a3 (I added a variable t1 = v9 * (v11 - v12) for better readability).

*** SKIP IF t1 NOT < a3 ***
In the second do-while loop, there is another if statement that checks v9 * 12 > v9 * 13
(Again, I added variables t2, t3 for clarity). If so, then v11 = v12. Then add 4 to v12. 
Increment v6. The while checks v9 * (v11 - v12) < a3 (t4 for clarity). After, the loop, 
a1 is assigned to v5.
***      END SKIP      ***

Then v9 = -v9. a2a is incremented. o1 = a2a + 1.

The while exits if v6 NOT < v5. 

After the nested loops, there is an if statement to see if o1 is odd. If so, it will 
decrement it and return it.
